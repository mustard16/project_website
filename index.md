        <div class="content has-text-justified">
With the growing ubiquity of smart and portable devices in local networks (LANs), DNS Service Discovery (DNS-SD) over multicast DNS (mDNS) has become essential for zero-configuration connectivity.  
Our measurements uncover <b>millions of open mDNS services<b> across <b>187 countries<b>, accessible due to misconfigurations and lack of access control. These services span six major categories of internal devices, posing risks such as remote exploitation and privacy leakage.  
We identify <b>protocol-level vulnerabilities<b> that enable high-volume reflection-based DDoS attacks, reaching <b>terabit-scale amplification<b>.  
We propose defenses including <b>optimized configurations<b>ï¼Œ <b>zero-trust access control<b>, å’Œ a <b>token-based authentication mechanism<b> for mDNS, validated in real-world Internet experiments.

## Developed Tools

- **mDNS Scanner** â€“ Custom multi-threaded script to identify open mDNS services on UDP port 5353.
- **Service Semantic Enhancer** â€“ Uses LLM + TF-IDF/LDA to classify and describe mDNS service names.
- **Web Snapshot Collector** â€“ Automated system for capturing HTTP/HTTPS pages linked from mDNS records.
- **mDNS Attack Simulator** â€“ Controlled testbed for measuring reflection amplification traffic patterns.
- **Token-based mDNS Auth** â€“ Modified Avahi implementation with authentication & rate-limiting defenses.

## Key Findings

- **327,702** unique hosts actively responding via mDNS, **187 countries**.
- **Top countries**: ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³ China (142,540), ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ USA (47,139), ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡· South Korea (27,023).
- **598 distinct service types** identified.
- **Terabit-scale amplification** possible with coordinated botnet abuse.
- Significant **privacy leaks**: IP/MAC addresses, personal names, emails, geographic locations.

## Simulated mDNS DDoS Attack Traffic

- **Query packet size**: ~167 bytes  
- **Average response size**: ~370 bytes  
- **Mean amplification factor**: **2.22** (max observed **21.0**)  
- **Max per-device response rate**: ~1000 pps (default cap)  
- **Example scenario**:  
  - 1,000 zombies Ã— 70 targets each â†’ **207.2 Gbps** reflected  
  - Global exposure potential â†’ **1.1 Tbps** (default limits) or **3.7 Tbps** (if limits bypassed)

## Proposed Defenses

1. **Configuration Hardening** â€“ Bind mDNS to local interfaces only.
2. **Firewall ACLs** â€“ Restrict UDP 5353 to trusted sources.
3. **Zero-trust Access Control** â€“ Only authenticated clients allowed.
4. **Token-based Authentication** â€“  
   - AC token: `SHA256(sip, sport, Pkey, Rkey)`  
   - Added in TXT records; backward compatible.
5. **Rate-limiting** â€“ Enforce RFC 6762 recommendations.
